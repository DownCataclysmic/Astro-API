This is my second project during my time as a QA Tech Specialist in training. The goal of this project is to create an API about whatever I wish, that integrates the technologies of an OOP (Java) with a database (SQL) as a back-end, and HTML and JavaScript as a front-end. This project will be hosted on GitHub pages for demo purposes.

This API will contain information about celestial objects such as stars, galaxies, and planets. The user will be able to add, delete, and update entries through the front end (HTML Webpage).
