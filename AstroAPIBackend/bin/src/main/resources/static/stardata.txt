    "starDescr":"Epsilon Eridani (Latinized from ε Eridani), formally named Ran, is a star in the southern constellation of Eridanus, at a declination of 9.46° south of the celestial equator. This allows it to be visible from most of Earth's surface. At a distance of 10.5 light-years (3.2 parsecs) from the Sun, it has an apparent magnitude of 3.73. It is the third-closest individual star or star system visible to the unaided eye. The star is estimated to be less than a billion years old. Because of its relative youth, Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of magnetic activity than the present-day Sun, with a stellar wind 30 times as strong."

    "starDescr":"HD 192310 (also known as 5 G. Capricorni or Gliese 785) is a star in the southern constellation of Capricornus. It is located in the solar neighborhood at a distance of almost 29 light years, and is within the range of luminosity needed to be viewed from the Earth with the unaided eye. (According to the Bortle scale, it can be viewed from dark suburban skies.) HD 192310 is suspected of being a variable star, but this is unconfirmed."
